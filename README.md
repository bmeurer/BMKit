Overview
========

BMKit is a collection of useful Objective-C classes and categories for iOS (and Mac) development, that I wrote in the past. I'm currently collecting and cleaning up the various bits and pieces, in order to stuff them into BMKit.

Right now, BMKit is a static library for iOS 4.0 and beyond.
